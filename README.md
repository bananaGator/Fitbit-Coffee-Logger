Fitbit Coffee Logger
====================

An app for the Fitbit Versa 3 or Fitbit Sense. It provides buttons for coffee,
tea and energy drinks the user can click to record the caffeine consumption. It
features an undo button and resets daily. When logged in it syncs to the fitbit
food api. It can be downloaded [here](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/60ea80eb-ebf3-491d-a66c-fb1dd4434fd5).

Roadmap
=======

Eventually I hope to make web apps which allow users to plot their caffeine consumption over time and plot it against their sleep quality and other health metrics.
